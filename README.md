# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores global COVID-19 data by cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing it using Python. It includes an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit to display dynamic trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

---

## 📊 Project Description

This project analyzes data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), focusing on:

* Daily and cumulative COVID-19 cases,
* Vaccination rates across countries,
* Death statistics.

Key tasks include:

1. Cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets,
2. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA),
3. Visualizing insights through static and interactive plots,
4. Deploying an interactive dashboard for real-time exploration.

## 🧠 Features

### 📌 Data Cleaning

* Handles missing values, duplicates, and outliers,
* Adds computed columns like rolling averages and normalized metrics.

### 📌 Visualization

* Time-series plots for global and country-specific trends,
* Choropleth maps to compare regions,
* Interactive charts using Streamlit widgets.

### 📌 Interactive Dashboard

* Built with Streamlit for a responsive UI,
* Supports filtering by country, date range, and metric type.
